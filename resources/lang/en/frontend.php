    'index_para_1' => 'Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a complex heterogeneous group of acute and chronic pulmonary disease that involves both lungs and often cripples the affected individual. In most situations, the aetiology is unknown and there is no known cure.. Many patients do not respond to any treatment and crave for oxygen even during trivial daily routine activities. Couple of decades back, ILD was considered a rare disease but now respiratory physicians are being confronted with more and more patients of ILD. Apparently, all ILD patients look similar but there are different patterns of the disease. About 200 clinical conditions /situations are associated with ILD..',
    'index_para_2' => 'ILD is disease of lung parenchyma involving the distal bronchioles and gas exchange units. The alveolar wall is composed of an epithelial barrier (type I and II alveolar epithelial cells, basement membrane, capillaries(endothelium) within the interstitium within which lies the connective tissue- the mesenchymal cells(fibroblast and myofibroblasts) alveolar macrophages and extracellular matrix components (collagen, elastin, proteoglycans). Although the interstitial space is a microscopic space between the basement membranes of the epithelium and the endothelium , the ‘disease’ of ILD is not confined to the interstitial space only as all cellular and soluble components of the alveolar wall and extends to the terminal bronchioles and in some diseasesincludes the pleura. In essence ILD is a broad range of disorders affecting the distal pulmonary parenchyma.',
    'index_para_3' => 'In the nineteenth century, lung fibrosis was called as ‘cirrhosis of the lung’. It was in 1944 that Louis Hamman and Arnold Rich first described pulmonary fibrosis. They reported four cases which presented with subacute respiratory failure which lead to death. They performed autopsy and found that these patients had interstitial fibrosis. It was the first pathological description of interstitial fibrosis. Thus, for the next few decades ILD was known as ‘Hamman-Rich syndrome’. It was probably the disease which is identified as acute interstitial pneumonia today.',
    'index_para_4' => 'However, doubts arose when clinicians identified a more chronic form of fibrosis separate from the disease described by Hamman and Rich. Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis was the term coined to describe the disease better. It is synonymous with IPF. In 1969, Liebow and Carrington differentiated interstitial lung diseases into five types usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), bronchiolitis obliterans interstitial pneumonia (BIP), lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP), and giant-cell interstitial pneumonia (GIP). In 1997, Liebow’s classification was modified with the addition of Respiratory bronchiolitis associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD) and Non specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and the term idiopathic interstitial pneumonias(IIP) was introduced in 2002 in a joint statement of the American Thoracic and European Respiratory societies as a consensus among a panel of ILD experts.',
    'index_para_5' => 'The incidence and prevalence of ILD and idiopathic interstitial pneumonias in India is unknown.The pattern, course and prognosis t ILD varies in different countries. In order to provide better care to the ILD patient in India, we need to understand the manifestation of ILDs in patients of Indian origin and living in India by reviewing all pertinent and relevant clinical data gathered from patients evaluated and managed by physicians in India. This can be best accomplished by data gathered prospectively .Therefore, need of ILD registry in India is evident.',

    'classification_para_1' => 'Since there were various classifications and no standardization, ATS/ERS, in attempt to standardize the approach towards ILD, issued guidelines in 2002. ATS/ERS classified ILD under the broader group of diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD). DPLD was classified in to DPLD of known cause, idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP), granulomatous DPLD and other forms of DPLD such as LAM, histiocytosis etc. IIP was further sub-grouped as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), respiratory bronchiolitis–associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP).',

    'classification_para_3' => 'Some characteristics of these ILD are as follows:',
    'classification_para_4' => 'These ILD are caused by some etiologic factors such as collagen vascular disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drugs etc',
    'classification_para_5' => 'Exposure to fungus like thermophilic actinomycetes and aspergillus is responsible for hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Exposure to damp walls and birds like pigeons, parrot, ducks can lead to hypersensitivity pneumonitis.',
    'classification_para_6' => 'When more than one family member(primary biological relative : siblings, children)  is diagnosed as having(i.e. ascertained diagnosis) IPF, it is called familial IPF. When the diagnosis of the ILD in the affected family member is not ascertained as IPF, then it is called Familial ILD /familial pulmonary fibrosis.',
